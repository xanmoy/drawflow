# DrawFlow

Welcome to DrawFlow! ðŸŽ¨ DrawFlow is a powerful web application that allows users to create, edit, and share flowcharts and diagrams with ease. It combines the flexibility of Next.js with the robust backend services of Convex and secure authentication via Kinde.

## Features

- **Intuitive Drawing Interface**: Easily create and manage flowcharts and diagrams with our user-friendly interface.
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Work on diagrams simultaneously with other users in real time.
- **Secure Authentication**: Sign up and log in using Kinde for a secure and smooth authentication process.
- **State Management**: Backend state management with Convex to ensure your diagrams are always saved and synchronized.

## Technologies

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-rendered or statically-exported React applications.
- **Convex**: A backend-as-a-service for managing real-time data and state.
- **Kinde**: Authentication platform for managing user identities and access.
